# sql-data-warehouse-project
Hi and welcome to **sql data warehouse project** where I’ve built a data warehouse from scratch using SQL Server and turned raw sales data into actionable business insights. 
The architechure I have followed is **[Medallion Architecture](https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture)**


##I’ve used SQL-based analytics to uncover key business insights — exploring:
**Customer behavior**: understanding who buys what and when
**Product performance**: identifying top-selling and underperforming products
**Sales trends**: analyzing revenue patterns over time to support better decisions

find below the image of the architecture -
